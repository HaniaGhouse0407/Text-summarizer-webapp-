# Text-summarizer-webapp-

The above project is a text summarizer web app built using Flask and the Hugging Face's BERT Tokenizer model, specifically the "paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2" model. Text summarization is the process of generating a concise and coherent summary of a given text. In this project, we leverage the power of Hugging Face's BERT-based model, which has been pre-trained on a large corpus of text data.

The web app allows users to input a piece of text, such as an article or a document, and then generates a summary of that text using the BERT Tokenizer model. The summarization process involves understanding the context and important information from the input text and generating a condensed version that captures the main points.

Flask, a popular Python web framework, is used to create the web app. It handles the routing and serves as the backend for the application. When a user submits a text, Flask processes the request and sends it to the BERT Tokenizer model for summarization. The model then generates a summary, which is returned to the user through the web app interface.

By leveraging Hugging Face's BERT Tokenizer model and Flask, this project provides an easy-to-use and accessible way for users to summarize their texts. It can be useful for a variety of applications, such as quickly extracting key information from lengthy articles or generating brief summaries of documents.
