# Text Summarizer Web App

This is a web application built using Flask and the Hugging Face's BERT Tokenizer model, specifically the "paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2" model. The app aims to provide text summarization functionality by generating concise summaries of given input texts.

**Please note that this project is currently a work in progress. Future updates and improvements are being actively made.**

## Project Status

As of now, the application is functional and capable of generating text summaries. However, there may be limitations and areas for improvement. We are continuously working on enhancing the summarization algorithm, improving the user interface, and addressing any issues that may arise.

## Future Updates

We have plans to implement the following updates in future versions of the app:

- Enhanced summarization algorithm for more accurate and coherent summaries
- Improved user interface and user experience
- Additional features, such as language support and customization options
- Bug fixes and performance optimizations
- integarte with private gpt to allow user to ask queries from documents ,research papers etc.
